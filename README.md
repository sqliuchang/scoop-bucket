# Sqliuchang Scoop Bucket

Extra manifests for [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), the Windows command-line installer. 
These are manifests for software I did not found in the main or extras buckets.

## How do I install these manifests?

To add this bucket, run `scoop bucket add sqliuchang https://github.com/sqliuchang/scoop-bucket.git`. 
To install, do `scoop install <manifest>`.
